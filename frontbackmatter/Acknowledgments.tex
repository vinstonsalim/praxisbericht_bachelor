\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I extend my deepest gratitude to Local Brand X GmbH for providing me with the invaluable opportunity to complete my Summer Internship during my final semester at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences. This experience has been pivotal in bridging the gap between theory and practice, allowing me to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my bachelor studies in Computer Science to real-world scenarios. 

\bigskip

\noindent I am particularly grateful to my supervisor, \mySupervisor, whose mentorship and expertise have been instrumental in shaping my learning experience. \mySupervisor's constructive feedback, encouragement, and willingness to challenge me have contributed significantly to my professional growth and development. Under his guidance, I have gained invaluable insights into Software Development and Project Management, and I am truly appreciative of the trust he has placed in me to contribute meaningfully to the projects undertaken by Local Brand X GmbH.

\bigskip

\noindent Lastly, I am indebted to the entire team at Local Brand X GmbH for their unwavering support, guidance, and hospitality throughout my internship journey.
